      <p>
        Academia depends on the circulation and exchange of ideas, but the tools we currently use have not been made
				with the needs of researchers in mind. The lack of collaborative tools, tedious publishing processes and friction
				are just a few of the problems this entails. Tools to improve our scholarly workflows already exist, but remain
				opaque for many of us, as academic craftsmanship is no priority in most university curricula.
			</p>
			<p>
				HYPERUNIVERSITY aims to bridge the incomplete digital turn in academia from solid analog techniques to digital
				ones, fit for the 21st century. HYPERUNIVERSITY provides curated resources for contemporary digital tools and
				training in computer skills to students and scholars in the humanities. HYPERUNIVERSITY delivers sustainable tool
				chains for scholarly work, from idea to publication, for authors and publishers. HYPERUNIVERSITY teaches note
				taking, text editing, reference management, layouting, and collaborative version control. HYPERUNIVERSITY
				contributes to public debates about research, editing, and digitized publishing practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				The working group HYPERUNIVERSITY consists of researchers from the humanities, social, and computer sciences.
				We learned how to use the free resources that others have generously shared on the web in order to reap the
				benefits of contemporary tooling. We want to give back what we have learned and encourage you to join us in this
				lifelong endeavour for a better and open world.

          In this tutorial, you will first learn the basics of Markdown—an easy to read and write
          markup syntax for plain text—as well as Pandoc, a command line tool that converts plain
          text into a number of beautifully formatted file types: PDF, .docx, HTML, LaTeX, slide
          decks, and more.

          This video tutorial will take you through the steps of installing and using the citation
          management program Zotero (version 4). If you're writing a paper with more than a few
          sources or putting together a thesis, investing the time into learning how to use Zotero
          will save you hours of headaches and heartaches down the road.

          A lot of people have asked me in recent weeks how git works. Git is a version control
          system (VCS) that was originally designed only with software developers in mind. However,
          git contains unique features that researchers in the arts and humanities can also make use of.

          Following some discussions over on the Zettlr forum I’m attempting to write up my workflow in
          some kind of coherent fashion. In the spirit of “working with the garage door open” I’m using
          a task that I’m working on right now. In stepping through the process, then my workflow will
          become clearer (to me, as well as you). As the genesis of this was to expand on how I use
          Zettlr, I hope that this will also be adequately addressed and prove helpful for others.
