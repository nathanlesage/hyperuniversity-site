  title: Git for Academics (video)
  description: |
     A lot of people have asked me in recent weeks how git works. Git is a version control
      system (VCS) that was originally designed only with software developers in mind. However,
      git contains unique features that researchers in the arts and humanities can also make use of.

  title: My Workflow (blog post)
  description: |
    Following some discussions over on the Zettlr forum I’m attempting to write up my workflow in
      some kind of coherent fashion. In the spirit of “working with the garage door open” I’m using
      a task that I’m working on right now. In stepping through the process, then my workflow will
      become clearer (to me, as well as you). As the genesis of this was to expand on how I use
      Zettlr, I hope that this will also be adequately addressed and prove helpful for others.
